The substitutional calculator was written in a day, but was the very first program I ever wrote (for academic purposes). At the time of its creation,
I was a graduate student in chemistry. As most grad students know, the pressure to conduct research and publish is insanely high, so I wrote this calculator to
streamline finding new chemical compositions. My work has much improved since this mini-project, since I now have a conventional computer science education. 
It's up on github mostly for the memories.
