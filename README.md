The substitutional calculator was written in a day, but was the very first program I ever wrote (for academic purposes). At the time of its creation,
I was a graduate student in chemistry. As most grad students know, the pressure to conduct research and publish is insanely high, so I wrote this calculator to
streamline finding new chemical compositions. My work has much improved since this mini-project, since I now have a conventional computer science education. 
It's up on github mostly for the memories.

# 2D and 3D Cooling
These were mini projects written in MatLab that use various toolkits to simulate heating and cooling of 2d and 3d objects. The files in both directories are 
not in any particular order.
